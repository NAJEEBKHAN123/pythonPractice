# print(''' In quiet hours when hopes feel low,
# And stars seem shy to even glow,
# Remember still — beneath your skin,
# There burns a fire, a light within.

# No storm can steal what you have grown,
# The seeds of strength are all your own.
# Though nights may stretch with silent pain,
# The sun will rise. You'll shine again.

# Not every path is lined with gold,
# But every dream is yours to hold.
# So walk with heart, and don’t let fear,
# Drown out the voice you need to hear.

# The world is vast, but so are you —
# With skies to reach and truths to view.
# Let courage bloom, let kindness spin,
# And trust the light you hold within. ''')
