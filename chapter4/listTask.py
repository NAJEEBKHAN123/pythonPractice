# ********************* TUPLE *********************

# ðŸ§© Task Steps:
# Create a tuple called marks with these numbers:
# (85, 90, 75, 90, 60, 90, 70)

# Print how many times the mark 90 appears in the tuple.

# Print the index of the first time 75 appears.

# Try to change a mark (e.g. marks[0] = 95) and observe the error.

# Convert the tuple to a list and add a new mark: 88.
# Then convert it back to a tuple and print it.

# solution 
# marks = (85, 90, 75, 90, 60, 90, 70)

# print(marks.count(90))
# print(marks.index(75))
# marks[0] = 100

# marks_list = list(marks)


# marks_list.append(88)

# marks = tuple(marks_list)



# print(marks)
